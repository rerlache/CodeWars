-- For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50
-- 
-- people table schema
-- - id
-- - name
-- - age
-- You should return all people fields where their age is over 50 and order by the age descending
-- 
-- NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

SELECT *
FROM people
WHERE age > 50
ORDER BY age DESC
